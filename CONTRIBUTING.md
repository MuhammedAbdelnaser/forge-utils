## Our Philosophy: Own Your Code for Speed and Control

`forge-utils` is built on the principle of **"copy, don't import"**. Our core belief is that developers gain significant advantages by directly incorporating utility functions into their codebase rather than relying on external dependencies. This philosophy directly translates to:

* **Accelerated Development**: No more debugging external libraries or waiting for dependency updates. You control the code, so you can fix, adapt, and build instantly.
* **Complete Customization**: Every utility is yours to modify. Tailor it precisely to your project's unique needs without fighting against rigid APIs.
* **Zero Dependency Bloat**: Only the code you use resides in your project. This means smaller bundle sizes and no unexpected runtime overhead.
* **Simplified Debugging**: Trace and debug functions directly within your project, making problem-solving more straightforward.
* **Future-Proofing**: Your utilities are part of your project's source, making them resilient to external library breaking changes.

When contributing, please keep this philosophy in mind. New utilities should be designed to be self-contained, easily digestible, and readily customizable once copied.
